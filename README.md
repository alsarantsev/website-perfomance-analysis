# Traffic and website performance analysis 

<p>The project involves working as an e-commerce database analyst for the Maven Fuzzy Factory, a burgeoning online retailer launching its initial product. The project aims to uncover potential blockbuster games and facilitate the planning of effective advertising campaigns.</p>

<p>The dataset available includes user and expert reviews, genres, platforms (such as Xbox or PlayStation), and historical data on game sales. The dataset provided covers historical data going back to 2016. Assuming it is December 2016, the project focuses on planning a campaign for the following year, 2017. The project's primary emphasis is on gaining experience in working with data, regardless of whether the goal is to forecast 2017 sales based on data from 2016 or analyze 2017 sales based on 2016 data.</p>

<p>Additionally, the dataset contains the abbreviation ESRB, which stands for the Entertainment Software Rating Board. ESRB evaluates the content of video games and assigns age ratings such as Teen or Mature to indicate the appropriate target audience for each game. This information is valuable in understanding the relationship between a game's content and its success in the market.</p>
